# professional-portfolio

This is my professional portfolio where I will post projects that I have done.

Project one is the Horseon refactor project that we completed.

The following is the URL of the webpage:
https://ctvb.github.io/professional-portfolio/

The following is a PDF of screenshots of the webpage:
[label](Untitled%20document.pdf)

Things that I found difficult about this project were getting cards to line up where I wanted them to on the page. I want to learn more about margins, padding, and flex to hopefully not have these same issues in the future. I also want to remove the bullet points that I have in the "Contact" section.

The links in the navigation bar link down to the sections that they indicate and the picture in the "Horseon Refactor" section links the the webpage that was refactored.

Lines 31-33 in the CSS sheet are currently commented out, I think as I work on this project I would like to add those lines of code in:
/* nav a:hover {
    color: var(--red);
} */

/* .contactinfo {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
} */

There is now an about me section with a working link in the navbar and the Horseon image links to the deployed Horseon page.
